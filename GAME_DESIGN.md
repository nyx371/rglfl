# GRIDFORGE — Game Design Document

A mobile-first factory/automation game in the spirit of Factorio, played entirely
by touch, running as a static vanilla-JS app on GitHub Pages.

**Current version: 0.1** — see [Version history](#version-history).

---

## Vision

Factorio's core loop — mine, smelt, craft, automate, research, expand — compressed
into something you can play one-handed on a phone. No player character: you are a
disembodied overseer panning across an infinite procedurally generated ore field.
Placement is tap-based, logistics are abstracted early (no belts in 0.1), and the
long game is driven by *crazy scaling*: exponential tech costs, multiplicative
stacking perks, and ore that gets richer the further you expand.

The roguelike twist: **Core Deposits** — huge, dense nodes scattered across the
world. Mining through one rewards a choice of 1 of 3 permanent upgrades, drawn
from a random pool. Runs stay fresh because your multiplier build path differs
every time.

## Design pillars

1. **Thumb-first.** Every interaction works with one finger: pan, pinch, tap,
   press-and-hold. No hover, no right-click, no keyboard.
2. **Automate or ache.** Manual mining (press-and-hold) works but is slow;
   the game constantly nudges you toward building the machine that does it for you.
3. **Numbers go vertical.** Multiplicative perk stacking × exponential repeatable
   techs × distance-scaled ore richness. Every system multiplies the others.
4. **Sessions of any size.** 30 seconds of tapping or an hour of factory layout
   both feel productive. State autosaves to localStorage.

## Core loop

```
press-hold mine → build drills → smelt plates → assemble parts
     ↑                                              ↓
perk choice ← crack core deposit ← expand outward ← research tech
```

## Systems (v0.1)

### World
- Infinite chunked grid, deterministic from a seed (value noise). Nothing is
  stored for untouched tiles; only deltas (depletion, buildings) are saved.
- Resource tiles: **iron ore, copper ore, coal, stone** near spawn; **crystal**
  appears further out. Each tile holds a finite (large) amount.
- **Distance scaling:** tile richness grows with distance from spawn, so
  expansion is always worth the logistics pain.
- Guaranteed starter patches of iron/copper/coal/stone near spawn so the
  opening is never a dud roll.

### Interaction
- **Pan:** one-finger drag. **Zoom:** pinch. No player character.
- **Manual mine:** press-and-hold any resource tile; a progress ring fills and
  yields resources repeatedly while held.
- **Build:** pick a building from the build sheet, tap valid tiles to place.
  Demolish refunds 50%.
- Double-tap zoom, text selection, and the iOS long-press magnifier are all
  suppressed — long-press is a *game verb* here.

### Production chain
| Building | Placed on | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Drill | ore/coal/stone tile | mines the tile into global storage |
| Smelter | any free tile | ore + coal → plates |
| Assembler | any free tile | plates → gears, wire, circuits, flasks |
| Lab | any free tile | consumes flasks → research points (RP) |

Logistics are abstracted in 0.1: all machines pull from and deposit into a
shared global inventory. Belts/inserters are a candidate for a later version.

Recipes: iron plate (2 ore + 1 coal), copper plate (2 ore + 1 coal),
gear (2 iron plate), wire (1 copper plate → 2), circuit (1 iron plate + 3 wire,
tech-gated), flask (1 gear + 1 wire), crystal flask (1 circuit + 2 crystal,
tech-gated, worth 10 RP).

### Tech tree
Research points (RP) come from labs. Two kinds of tech:
- **Repeatable multipliers** with exponential cost (×3 per level): drill speed,
  smelt speed, craft speed, research speed, manual mining. These never run out.
- **One-off unlocks:** Electronics (circuits), Crystal Drilling (drills work on
  crystal), Advanced Flasks (10-RP crystal flasks), Blast Drilling (drill
  output ×2).

### Core Deposits (roguelike layer)
- Rare dense nodes; HP scales with distance from spawn.
- Damaged by press-and-hold mining (drills can't crack them in 0.1).
- On destruction: modal offers **1 of 3 perks** from a pool, e.g. drill speed ×2,
  smelter speed ×2, research ×2, manual mining ×3, 20% drill double-strike,
  +50% drill yield, core deposits take double damage, instant resource cache.
- Perks stack multiplicatively with each other and with techs — this is the
  engine of the crazy scaling.

### Persistence
Autosave to localStorage every few seconds and on tab hide. Save stores
inventory, RP, techs, perks, placed buildings, tile deltas, camera, and seed.

## UI layout

- **Top bar:** version badge (v0.1 + what's-new snippet), RP counter,
  scrolling row of nonzero inventory counts.
- **Bottom bar:** Build / Tech / Perks / Inventory sheet toggles.
- **Sheets** slide up from the bottom; the map stays live behind them.
- All symbols are SVG path icons from [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net)
  (CC BY 3.0 — authors: lorc, delapouite, faithtoken). No emojis, ever.

## Technical notes

- Vanilla JS, zero dependencies, static hosting on GitHub Pages from `main`.
- Canvas 2D renderer; icons drawn as `Path2D` from embedded game-icons path data.
- `index.html` references assets with `?v=<stamp>` query strings;
  `tools/bump-cache.sh` rewrites the stamp and **must be run before every push**
  so GitHub Pages caches never serve stale code.
- Gesture suppression: `touch-action: none`, `user-select: none`,
  `-webkit-touch-callout: none`, `gesturestart`/`dblclick`/`contextmenu`
  preventDefault, `viewport` meta with `user-scalable=no`.

## Roadmap

- **0.2** — belts/logistics tier, storage caps, offline progress.
- **0.3** — power system, steel/advanced material tier, drill-vs-core mining.
- **0.4** — prestige loop ("re-seed the planet"), perk rarity tiers, biomes.
- **0.5** — sound, haptics, achievements, cloud save export.
